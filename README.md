## Hello

I'm Julia Piaskowski, a statistician at the University of Idaho, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. I try to provide resources to support high quality analysis of agriculture studies and adjacent research. I view myself as a 'user advocate' attempting to bridge the gap between complex statistical methodologies/tools and what users actually need to use those. I'm also a Software Carpentries certified instructor. 

#### Some Resources I maintain or help maintain :wrench:

- [Agriculture CRAN Task View](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Agriculture): to find that R package supporting your agriculture research needs. 
- [Mixed Model CRAN Task View)(https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MixedModels): to find that mixed modellling package in R
- [Introductory R for Scientists](https://idahoagstats.github.io/r-for-ag-scientists/): zero-to-hero coursework content for learning R!
- [University of Idaho Agricultural Statistics Resources Website](https://agstats.io/): collection of tutorials, workshops and blog posts supporting analysis of research data
- [Field Guide to Incorporating Spatial Covariates into Analysis of Planned Field Experiments]([Agricultural Field Experiments](https://idahoagstats.github.io/guide-to-field-trial-spatial-analysis/) 
- [Irregular Newsletter on Ag Stats](https://buttondown.email/Uidaho-stat-programs): sent a few times per year
- [WAVE: Western Agriculture Variety Explorer](www.westernagdata.org): for accessing variety testing data from Idaho, Oregon and Washington

#### Other Stuff  :speech_balloon:

I'm currently working on building guides to linear mixed modelling, *generalized* linear mixed modelling and reproducible research for busy scientists (links forthcoming when the resources are complete). 

My [personal website](https://jpiaskowski.gitlab.io/) is actually deployed through GitLab, but I use GitHub for most things. I also blog on prison and criminal justice issues [here](www.idahoprisonproject.org).
